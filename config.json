//You Can Change The Prefix To Whatever You Want
//ID means your Discord User ID (ID is required for DisableEveryone Thing)
//If You Do Not Change The ID Then When You Will Set DisableEveryone To True Then Only I Can Use The Commands Of This Nuker And Not You
//So Make Sure To Replace My User ID With Your User ID
//When DisableEveryone is set at true then only the person whose id is given in the id field will be able to use the nuker's commands
//and when it is set to false than anyone present on the server where the nuker is present could use the nuker's commands
